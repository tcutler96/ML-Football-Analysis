# ML Football Analysis

Using Python, this project utilises machine learning, computer vision, and deep learning to analyse football matches. It applies YOLOv8 for object detection, tracking players, referees, and the ball across frames. A custom-trained detector improves accuracy. KMeans clustering identifies team colours, while optical flow tracks camera movement. Perspective transformation converts pixel data into real-world distances, allowing speed and movement analysis.
