# AI/ ML Football Analysis

This project builds a computer vision system that analyses football footage using AI and machine learning. It detects players, referees, and the ball, tracks movement across frames, measures distance and speed, and provides real-time insights into player performance.

Using Python, YOLOv8, OpenCV, and KMeans, the system identifies players, assigns them to teams based on shirt colour, and applies optical flow and perspective transformation to convert pixel movement into real-world metrics. The project demonstrates key skills in deep learning, object detection, tracking, and data-driven sports analysis.

Main Features:

Object detection with YOLOv8 (players, referees, footballs).

Custom model training for improved accuracy.

Player team classification using KMeans clustering.

Camera motion estimation via optical flow.

Perspective transformation for real-world distance measurement.

Calculation of player speed and distance covered.

Tools and Libraries:
Python, OpenCV, Ultralytics YOLOv8, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib
